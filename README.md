## ⚡ Performance Excellence

This portfolio is engineered for a "Very, Very Fast" user experience:
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint):** ~144ms.
- **Extreme Image Optimization:** All assets converted to compressed JPEG (~80% quality), reducing payload by >80%.
- **Zero Layout Shift:** Implemented fixed aspect-ratios and dimensions for all media.
- **GPU Acceleration:** High-fidelity animations utilize `will-change` property for buttery smooth 60fps interaction.
- **Modern Delivery:** Resource hints (`preconnect`, `dns-prefetch`), asynchronous image decoding, and deferred JavaScript execution.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Core:** Semantic HTML5, Vanilla CSS3 (Custom Design System).
- **Interactions:** Vanilla JavaScript (Intersection Observer, Scroll-driven transforms).
- **Forms:** Netlify Forms with a specialized AJAX submission handler for zero-refresh UX.
- **Visuals:** Apple-inspired "Product Reveal" animations, GPU-accelerated 3D transforms, and glassmorphism.
- **Deployment:** Automated CI/CD via GitHub and Netlify.

## 🚀 Local Development

To run this project locally, you just need a simple HTTP server (to ensure Netlify form simulation and relative paths work correctly):

1. **Option A (VS Code):** Install "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live".
2. **Option B (Python):** Run `python -m http.server 8000` in the directory.
3. **Option C (Node):** Run `npx serve .`

## 🌐 Netlify Deployment

This portfolio is optimized for Netlify:
- **Netlify Forms:** Automatically detected. No backend required.
- **Build Settings:** 
  - Build Command: `npm run build` (or leave empty as it's static).
  - Publish Directory: `.` (root).
- **Configuration:** Handled via the included `netlify.toml` file.

## 🧪 Selected Work

The portfolio features a cinematic Bento Grid layout showcasing key projects:
- **NYC Taxi Insights:** Big Data analytics on billions of records using PySpark.
- **HealthTriage AI:** Award-winning healthcare platform using GPT-4.
- **SEC Knowledge Graph:** Financial relationship discovery with Neo4j.
- **And more...** (Loan Risk, Energy Markets, NLP Engines).

## 📬 Contact Form Integration

The contact form is fully integrated with Netlify's serverless forms.
- **AJAX Submission:** Users can send messages without a page reload.
- **Spam Protection:** Built-in honeypot and Netlify security.
- **Feedback:** Real-time success/error notifications with smooth scrolling.
